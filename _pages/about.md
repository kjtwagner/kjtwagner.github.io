I am a first year Ph.D. student at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am interested in the search for continuous gravitational waves, especially from LMXB Scorpius X-1. I currently work with [Dr. John Whelan](https://ccrgpages.rit.edu/~whelan/).

Before joining the [AST program](https://www.rit.edu/science/school-physics-and-astronomy) at RIT, I received my B.S. in Physics from Roberts Wesleyan College. I supplemented my program with extra courses in astronomy and mathematics from both RIT and the University of Rochester. I was an undergraduate research assistant to [Dr. Alice Quillen](http://astro.pas.rochester.edu/~aquillen/) (UR), studying the properties of viscoelastic rotators, and Dr. John Whelan (RIT), exploring lattice template placement.

Additionally, at RWC I was a member of the Division II women's varsity soccer team and played the violin in the community orchestra. Now in my free time, I enjoy running, garment sewing and quilting, and spending time with my husband and our two cats.
