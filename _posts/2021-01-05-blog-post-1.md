An attempt to grow herbs year-round using hydroponics.

The Idea
======
During each weekly grocery trip, I find myself standing in front of the wide selection of fresh herbs in the produce section of my local grocery store. I love to cook with fresh herbs - I think the flavors in my cooking are enhanced by using fresh, rather than dried. However, when a single dish uses an entire bunch of herbs, this preference gets pretty pricey.

Nearly weekly, I have found myself wishing that I had plants at home that would replenish the supply of herbs that I keep on hand. I have plenty of other houseplants, so I figure herbs can't be that difficult relatively. 

The Process
