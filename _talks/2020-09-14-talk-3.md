Presentation to other members of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration on my research to improve computing cost for our search for continuous gravitational waves.

Members of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration meet semi-annually, usually in March and September, for a meeting program including research presentations from the various member subgroups, poster sessions, and workshops. I presented in the Continuous Wave session in September 2020, as the only first year graduate student.

My presentation described improvements made to lattice choices and coordinates for the cross-correlation search for continuous gravitational waves from Scorpius X-1, to that point. It summarized two summers worth of work.
