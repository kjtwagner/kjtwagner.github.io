Presentation at the end of my Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) at Rochester Institute of Technology, working with Dr. John Whelan.

As part of my participation in an [NSF-sponsored REU](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/list_result.jsp?unitid=5045) experience at RIT, I gave a culminating presentation on the work I completed during the summer months. This included quantitative results for a reduction in template count for a cross-correlation search for continuous gravitational waves from LMXB Scorpius X-1.
